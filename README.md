```
If the day is done,
If birds sing no more,
If the wind has fiagged tired,
The draw the veil of darkness thick upon me,
Even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed,
The petals of dropping lotus at dusk,
From the taverer,
Whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended,
Whose garment is torn and dust-laden,
Whose strength is exhausted,remove shame and poverty,
And renew has life like a flower under,
The cover of thy kindly night

```
