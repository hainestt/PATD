```
If the day is done ,
If birds sing no more .
If the wind has fiagged tired ,
Then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me ,
Even as thou hast wrapt the earth with The coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed ,
The petals of the drooping lotus at dusk.
From the traverer,
Whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended ,
Whose garment is torn and dust-laden ,
Whose strength is exhausted,remove shame and poverty ,
And renew his life like a flower under
The cover of thy kindly night .

假如时光已逝，
鸟儿不再歌唱，
风儿也吹倦了，
那就用黑暗的厚幕把我盖上，
如同黄昏时节你用睡眠的衾被裹住大地，
又轻轻合上睡莲的花瓣。
路途未完，行囊已空,
衣裳破裂污损，人已精疲力竭。
你驱散了旅客的羞愧和困窘，
使他在你仁慈的夜幕下，
如花朵般焕发生机,
在你慈爱的夜幕下苏醒。
```
